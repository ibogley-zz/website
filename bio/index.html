          <h2>My Background</h2>
          <p>
            I grew up in Corvallis, nestled in the beautiful scenery of the Willamete Valley and listening the roar of Reser Stadium every Saturday. I went to high school at Crescent Valley, where I had the privilege of playing ultimate frisbee competitively. Over the course of 5 years, our team won many state championships in the mixed division. Also, I was able to take part in an Oregon All-Star team, named "Oregon Flood", which took home the gold in the YCC 2014 Mixed division. Since hanging up my cleats, I've begun practicing Brazillian Jiu Jitsu with a local club.
          <p>
            I began my higher education as a math major at the historic Oregon State University, a cornerstone of the Oregonian economy and an institution widely heralded for its research activity. Ironically, I ended up transferring to the rival school: the University of Oregon. It certainly seems fitting that I grew up watching the Beavers destroyed year after year in the... competitively named "civil war", only to transfer the year the tides turned!
          </p>
          <p>
            Since joining the ducks and switching to economics, I've been thrilled with the quality of my education. Here at the U of O I've spent my time learning cutting edge forecasting techniques with Professor <a href="https://pages.uoregon.edu/duy/">Tim Duy</a>, observing the diverse effects of local ecosystems on Oregonian economies with <a href="https://honors.uoregon.edu/ed-whitelaw">Professor Ed Whitelaw</a>, understanding core market structures with <a href="http://www.keatonmiller.org/">Keaton Miller</a>, exploring the impacts of socio-economic environments with <a href="https://pages.uoregon.edu/bchansen/">Professor Ben Hansen</a>, empowering myself via the programming language R under Doctoral Students <a href="https://github.com/LuEtcheverry">Luciana Etcheverry</a> (Instructor) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/connor-lennon-806457b5/">Connor Lennon</a> (TA), as well as scaling up into the big data arena with <a href="https://grantmcdermott.com/">Asst. Professor Grant McDermott</a>. Each of these teachers has given me benefits both intangible and observable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since my first memorable years as an elementary student, I've been blessed with a knack for mathematics. While the statement may seem arrogant at first, it is clearly a credit to the influence of having dual mathematicians for parents. However, a consistent frustration of mine was the abstract nature of many techniques learned from geometry or calculus, showing no utility beyond the hypothetical word problems asking how fast a train is going.
          </p>
          <p>
            My choice to delve into the world of economics has exposed the techniques beat into my head with pre-algebra worksheets to real world scenarios and issues. Whereas before graphs were used to depict hypothetical limits to how much "Jimmy" could eat, now my teachers gave explicit and effective frameworks by which to describe human behavior in magnitudes of scale I thought were relegated to government super computers. My most cherished skill from my time here is specifically the experience I have gained with the R programming language. The interconnected nature of our digital world now allows an infinite playground for our curiosity, allowing insights and progress in issues considered insurmountinable and on scales we thought unimaginable.
          </p>
          <p>
            I look forward to the opportunity of working with such questions on a daily basis in a role that allows such work to help organizations achieve their perspective goals. This is the fundamental motive behind my interest in data science. To evaluate my current skillset, check out the projects tab to look through some previous adventures.
