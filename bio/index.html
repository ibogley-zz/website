          <h2>My Background</h2>
          <p>
            I grew up in Corvallis, nestled in the Willamete Valley and listening the roar of Reser Stadium every Saturday. My high school days were spent at Crescent Valley, where I had the privilege of playing ultimate frisbee competitively. Over the course of 5 years, our team won state championships in the mixed division, and during the summers I was able to take part in an Oregon All-Star team, named "Oregon Flood", which took home the gold in the YCC 2014 Mixed division. Since hanging up my cleats, I've begun practicing Brazillian Jiu Jitsu with the UO BJJ club.
          <p>
            I began my higher education as a math major at Oregon State University. Ironically, I ended up transferring to the rival school: the University of Oregon, where I studied economics, business administration, and mathematics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here at the U of O I've spent my time learning about cutting edge forecasting techniques, the diverse effects of local ecosystems on Oregonian economies,  industrial organization, the impacts of socio-economic environments, unraveling the web of globalisation, studying macroeconmic modeling and policy, discovering the programming language R, as well as scaling up into the big data arena. Each of these teachers has given me benefits both intangible and observable.
          </p>
          <p>
            I look forward to the opportunity of utilize my curiousity on a daily basis in a role that allows such work to help organizations achieve their perspective goals. Whether in the private, public, or non-profit sectors, I judge my success based on the value I bring to my collegues. To evaluate my current skillset, check out the projects tab to look through some previous adventures.
