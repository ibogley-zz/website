          <h2>My Background</h2>
          <p>
            I grew up in Corvallis, nestled in the beautiful scenery of the Willamete Valley and listening the roar of Reser Stadium every Saturday. My high school days were spent at Crescent Valley, where I had the privilege of playing ultimate frisbee competitively. Over the course of 5 years, our team won state championships in the mixed division, and during the summers I was able to take part in an Oregon All-Star team, named "Oregon Flood", which took home the gold in the YCC 2014 Mixed division. Since hanging up my cleats, I've begun practicing Brazillian Jiu Jitsu with the UO BJJ club.
          <p>
            I began my higher education as a math major at Oregon State University, a cornerstone of the Oregonian economy and an institution widely heralded for its research activity. Ironically, I ended up transferring to the rival school: the University of Oregon. It certainly seems fitting that I grew up watching the Beavers destroyed year after year in the civil war, only to transfer the year the tides turned!
          </p>
          <p>
            Since joining the ducks and switching to economics, I've been thrilled with the quality of my education. Here at the U of O I've spent my time learning cutting edge forecasting techniques with Professor <a href="https://pages.uoregon.edu/duy/">Tim Duy</a>, observing the diverse effects of local ecosystems on Oregonian economies with <a href="https://honors.uoregon.edu/ed-whitelaw">Professor Ed Whitelaw</a>, understanding industrial organization with <a href="http://www.keatonmiller.org/">Keaton Miller</a>, exploring the impacts of socio-economic environments with <a href="https://pages.uoregon.edu/bchansen/">Professor Ben Hansen</a>, discovering the programming language R under Doctoral Students <a href="https://github.com/LuEtcheverry">Luciana Etcheverry</a> (Instructor) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/connor-lennon-806457b5/">Connor Lennon</a> (TA), as well as scaling up into the big data arena with <a href="https://grantmcdermott.com/">Asst. Professor Grant McDermott</a>. Each of these teachers has given me benefits both intangible and observable.
          </p>
          <p>
            I look forward to the opportunity of utilize my curiousity on a daily basis in a role that allows such work to help organizations achieve their perspective goals. This is the fundamental motive behind my interest in data science. To evaluate my current skillset, check out the projects tab to look through some previous adventures.
