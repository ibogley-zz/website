    Hello, my name is Ian. I graduated from the University of Oregon in 2020 and am now pursuing a Master's in Applied Economics from the same institution. Check out my bio for more information on where I grew up, my previous personal exploits, etc.

    I made this page with the intent of creating an online presence. This site is meant to be a representitive of my professional career and aspirations. Currently, I take inspiration from several of the teachers I've worked with here at the U of O, guiding me toward the opportunity to work in the data science industry.
