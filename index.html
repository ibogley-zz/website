            My generation is growing up during the golden age of information and data. The internet, paired with digital tools available to us, provide an excellent opportunity to re-evaluate the way we make decisions and plan for a better future. My passion is to use data analysis for economic development, growth, and informed decision-making. I have relevant experience using both written and visual mediums for communication of data-based insights.
