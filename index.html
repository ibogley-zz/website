    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
      Growing up in Corvallis, I grew up watching Jaquizz Rodgers and the OSU Neavers fill Reser Stadium every Saturday. I still remember frequenting the Old-World-Deli, where the staff were always kind enough to invite me into their establishment with a sandwhich made from scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to highschool at Crescent Valley, located in the hills of Northern Corvallis, where stepping outside the inner courtyard transported you to rural Oregon in all its glory. While I was there, I played Ultimate Frisbee for their program, winning state championships, as well as competing at the National Youth Club Championships. I was fortunate enough to be a part of some successful teams, including the Oregon Flood team in 2014 which was crowned champions of the mixed division that year.

    <p>
      After a brief stint in football during college, where I played for the Eugene City Bills as a safety, I decided to focus on my studies and for preparing myself for the first stage of my career. Currently, I am treasurer of the UO Brazillian Jiu Jitsu Club, where I have been practicing and sparring for a year and a half.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began my college career at Oregon State University. For any that know the local quirks of our relationship, this could be considered a strange move. Every year the football game between us is compared to a civil war, with each side ever increasing in competitiveness. Ironically, after years of watching the Ducks destroy my home team, the first time I watched the Beavers win the grudge match was the year I transferred to the loosing side.

    <p>
      Nevertheless, my journey here at the University of Oregon has been incredible. I came into my college career with no vision of what I wanted to do afterwards. The son of two mathematicians, I chose math as my major and never gave it a second thought. However, the sometimes unwieldy, abstract nature of the subject often discourged sentiments that such knowledge would actually be useful after college. My foray into Economics has eliminated all such thought. From the tireless work of my educators to describe useful theory to the focus on implementing the programming language R, I have access to the necessary tools to begin creating reports and summaries that hold weight. Whereas before I could only imagine the questions necessary to describe operations and organizations of scale, now big data is an incredible resource.
    </p>
    <p>
      From describing the impact of macro-economic variables such as consumer sentiment, to the study of changes in global retail, to the results of a survey, the tools given to me have already pulled their weight. An example of this occured during my junior year of college, when I met a man named Mathew at a university career fair. Learning that he worked for a non-profit called ShelterCare, I asked if there were any opportunities to utilize my skills. In return, he gave me an excel spreadsheet with employee satisfaction survey results. I was tasked with making use of this information, which I fulfilled by creating a methodology for utilizing such data in conjunction with workplace initiatives to improve the work environment. This project can be seen within my portfolio, along with others.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been spending much of my time during these uncertain times creating projects showcasing my limited programming knowledge, and I am excited to further gain influence and expertise in approaching data driven questions. From exploring the origins of American political thought to the forecast of uncertain futures, I am confident that the skills I bring to the table will be an asset for organizations looking to attack data driven issues.

      Please take a look at my projects, or look through my resume and other documents. Also feel free to contact me for information about future opportunities, including temporary assignments like my collaboration with ShelterCare.
